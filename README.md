\# Heart Disease Prediction System



This project predicts the presence of heart disease using Machine Learning techniques.  

The application takes medical parameters as input and provides prediction results through an interactive Streamlit web application.

\## Project Overview



The objective of this project is to build an end-to-end Machine Learning system that helps in early detection of heart disease using clinical data.



The project includes:

\- Data preprocessing

\- Feature selection

\- Model training using Random Forest

\- Model serialization using Joblib

\- Deployment using Streamlit Cloud

\## Input Features



The model uses the following medical parameters:



\- slope\_of\_peak\_exercise\_st\_segment

\- thal

\- resting\_blood\_pressure

\- chest\_pain\_type

\- num\_major\_vessels

\- fasting\_blood\_sugar\_gt\_120\_mg\_per\_dl

\- resting\_ekg\_results

\- serum\_cholesterol\_mg\_per\_dl

\- oldpeak\_eq\_st\_depression

\- sex

\- age

\- max\_heart\_rate\_achieved

\- exercise\_induced\_angina
